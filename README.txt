Course Description
Digital logic, circuit components. Data representation, computer architecture and implementation, assembly language programming/Basics of how computers work from implementation to system software



C code written for Computer Organization Class

Hello_World.c: takes input a number from 1-5 and prints "Hello Wolrd" that many times

Sum_Mean_Product.c: takes input of 5 floating point numbers and prints the sum, mean and product

Factorial.c: takes input of a number and computes the factorial

Analyze_String.c: takes a text string as input, prints the string backwards and forwards, then prints the number of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits and other characters present in the string

Array_Multiplication.c: takes as input two 3x3 matricies, prints both of the matrices, then prints the product of the first matrix by the second and the product of the second matrix by the first

Bubble_Sorts: a collection of bubble sort programs that order a set of character strings, including:
Bubble_Sort_Without_Cfuncs: bubble sort without the use of built in C string functions
Bubble_Sort_With_Cfuncs: bubble sort with built in C string functions
Bubble_Sort_With_Pointers: bubble sort writen with pointers instead of arrays

a_to_i.c: program that converts a string of ASCII digits to a 32-bit integer

i_to_a.c: program that converts a 32-bit integer to a string of ASCII digits

Linked_List_And_Structs: program that creates a singly linked list of point structs (which include an x and y coordinate) and uses this information to print the square of the distance from each point to the origin (0, 0)
